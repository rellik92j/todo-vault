# Future ideas

Unscheduled ideas that haven't earned a PLAN.md phase or a PLAN-*.md design doc
yet. When one is ready to build, promote it: either a new phase in PLAN.md, or
its own `PLAN-<name>.md` if it needs real design work first (see PLAN-LINKS.md
for the shape of one of those).

Newest at the top. No status tracking here — once something's picked up, its
entry moves out to wherever it's being built.

## `doctor` should check that attachments resolve

`doctor` validates dangling parents, item links, and absolute `file` links
(`cli.ts`), but never checks that an item's `attachments` entries exist on disk.
A missing attachment is silent — the item still lists `attachments/ACME-2/spec.pdf`
in frontmatter and nothing reports that the file is gone.

Today git makes that mostly theoretical, since `attachments/` is tracked along
with everything else. It stops being theoretical the moment a vault is copied
without hidden files, restored from a partial backup, or opened on a machine
where auto-commit was never healthy — all cases `gitStatus()` already exists to
warn about. The check is a few lines next to the existing `link.type === "file"`
branch, using `resolveAttachment()` to get the native path.

Came up while deciding whether to gitignore `attachments/`. Decided not to — the
whole point of `copy: true` is that the file is versioned with the item, and
`copy: false` is already the escape hatch for anything large. But that ruling
leans on git being healthy, and this check is what makes the failure visible
instead of silent.
